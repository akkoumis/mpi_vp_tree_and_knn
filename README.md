# mpi VP Tree and kNN
This program creates a vp tree in parallel, using the MPI interface, and searches for the nearest neighbors of the leafs.

The program was developed using totalSize = 64 and everything worked fine. However, when using greater numbers, an error occurs in int index1G, for no apparent reason.

More debugging and work needed to sort these details out.

The project will be finished, regardless of the assignment. It's a matter of principle.
